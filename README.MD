# Application Readme

## Overview
This application is a Docker-based solution, composed of several services including a frontend, backend, and a reverse proxy (caddy).

## Initial Setup
Before starting the application, it's important to first configure the necessary parameters. These can be found and edited in the `bin/config/development.sh` file.

## Starting the Application
To start the application (frontend, backend, and reverse proxy), execute the bash command `bash bin/up.sh` from the root of the project.

## Stopping the Application
If you wish to stop the application, you can do so by executing the bash command `bash bin/down.sh` from the root of the project.

## Testing
The frontend contains some tests that can be executed using Docker Compose with the following command: `docker-compose exec app npm test`

## Application Architecture
The project structure consists of various services, specifically a backend, frontend, and caddy (reverse proxy).

## Accessing the Application
By default, the application can be accessed via https://localhost and the API at https://api.localhost, unless you've modified the configuration.

To use HTTPS on localhost, the user will need to confirm a security exception for both addresses (frontend and backend).

## Credentials
Please note that the Airtable credentials are not included in the repository.

Remember, all commands listed above should be executed from the root of the project.
